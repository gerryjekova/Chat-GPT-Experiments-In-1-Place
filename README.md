Take on the role of a Professional Web Developer that Specializes in UI Design. I want you to generate me a static HTML, CSS and JavaScript website in a link tree format with a space to put my avatar in a circle shape that serves as a frame, no need for an avatar to actually be put inside, but a placeholder and a comment to indicate where I should insert it in the code would be appreciated. 
The link tree itself:  
- I would like there to be 5 buttons for starters 
- The buttons should be wide around 1/3 of the screen and centered in a column like the classic link tree format
- I want the buttons to have a slightly rounded edge shape, but not too much.. only a tiny bit and I want the buttons to include a border with a width that is appropriate depending on the size of the screen and intuitive (to complement the shape of the button nicely) 
- I want the background of the site to be with colors and possibly even star shapes like a night sky with emojis or whatever design tools you have at your disposal or even leave placeholders for me to design, but I want the background to be in the color of the Night Sky and to have little figures like stars to be spread across the background with 75% opacity for the shapes/images covering the sky.
- That being said, I would like the container that handles the Buttons Column in the center to have an independent background that helps the buttons stand out but also blends with the background, so to have around 50% opacity
- I would like the link buttons Borders to be in `5BBCFF` color 100% opacity and the link Buttons background color to be in `FFD1E3` color. 
- Wrap links around the buttons themselves, not the text in the buttons (the buttons themselves must serve as the links)
- Button background to change on hovering action to `FF7EE2`
- The text of the buttons would be `FF008E` and bolded in a Comic Sans font all capitalized letters
- For the visited button links, you can change the text inside the buttons to `D5FFE4` to indicate the link was visited to the user IF ITS POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS (considering the button element itself would be the link and not the text)
- The Site Title would be "Gerry's Public Resources" 
- The buttons in the link tree: 
1 - I want a Button with Title "Урок за ‘нещо програмистко’ Ниво начинаещо (Ъпдейтната) - Изтегли PDF Директно  
- I want this button's link to be a downloadable PDF file that I will insert in it, but I want it to function and to have a placeholder ready for me 
2 - Button with Title "Колелото На Късмета - Правила и Описание" 
- This button leads to a placeholder link to a website (the remaining buttons of the Link Tree for now - from 2 to 5 also point to website links with target="_blank" property on all of them)  
3 - Button with Title "Сайт за Полезни, Бързи и Безплатни Онлайн Инструменти и Ресурси" 
- This button leads to a placeholder link to a website (the remaining buttons of the Link Tree for now - from 2 to 5 also point to website links with target="_blank" property on all of them)  
4 - Button with Title "ПОКАНА ЗА ДИСКОРД ОБЩНОСТТА МИ" 
- This button leads to a placeholder link to a website (the remaining buttons of the Link Tree for now - from 2 to 5 also point to website links with target="_blank" property on all of them)  
5 - Button with Title "Базата Ми Данни/Блог, Където Записвам Статии за Нещата, Които Уча" 
- This button leads to a placeholder link to a website (the remaining buttons of the Link Tree for now - from 2 to 5 also point to website links with target="_blank" property on all of them)
